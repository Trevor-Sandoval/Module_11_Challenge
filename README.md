# Module_11_Challenge

Background
---
You’re now ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.
As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.
What You're Creating

This new assignment consists of two technical products. You will submit the following deliverables:
---
Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
-
Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
-

Please note that some portions of my code's structure were inspired by my research on the internet in addition to the hyperlinked module resources emailed to us by Melissa Conner. At the beginning of this boot camp, we were encouraged to be proactive with utilizing the internet as a resource for finding solutions to complex problems that also contributed to our edification. Thus, I was able to formulate my assignment after conducting some independent research on Stack Overflow and Google Search.
